This directory contains a way to serve static assets,
as a microapplication, without loading a Laravel kernel.

The goal is to speed up development process and avoid to watch with gulp or
grunt static resouces modifications, but to regenerate them at runtime.

This is intended for front-end development, and not for production.

The entry point could be found at public/stylesheet.php
